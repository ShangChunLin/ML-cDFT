# ML-cDFT
Machine learning classical density functional theory (ML-cDFT)

One need Jupyter notebook the python3 for training, and CUDA (also Nvidia GPU, of course) if want to generate own data.  

A machine learning method to approximate the classical free energy density functional. The detail could be found in SciPost, https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys.6.2.025

Usaully ML is a black box to theoretical physicists, here I try to discover the insight and connect ML and cDFT. 
This was a side project to answer, "Could ML find a free energy density?". The answer is, sort of yes, as least I could approximate it. 
A good free energy density require hard works and incredible physical insight, such as fundmental measure theory for hard sphere colloid. However, even we have good approximation for that (hard sphere system), by adding mean field for attractive potential, it usually got spoiled. Thus, I propose a ML method to improve such situation. It turns out that the idea could atually improve the attractive part that better than mean field treatment with simple convolution and multiplication network.    

In the paper I apply the idea to the 1D LJ fluid to prove the concept. The training data are grand canonical MC simulation and speeded up by GPU (CUDA), and training by python (in Jupyter notebook). The training should be able to imposed by Tensorflow, but I fail. As I said, it was a side project and my GPUs are busy for other stuff anyway. It will be very appreciated if someone could write the training part by Tensorflow.
